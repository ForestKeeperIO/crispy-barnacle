## Challenge.sol

Challenge.sol is a simple smart contract implemented in Solidity programming language. This contract creates a basic ERC-20 token with the ability to mint and burn tokens. The contract has three public variables that can be accessed by anyone: name, symbol, and totalSupply. It also has a balances mapping that maps the balance of each address to the number of tokens they own.

## Getting Started
# Prerequisites

To use this smart contract, you will need the following:

A local development environment, such as Remix
A wallet, such as MetaMask with testnet eth

# Installing

Open Remix and create a new file named MyToken.sol.
Copy the code from this repository and paste it into MyToken.sol.
Compile the code by clicking the "Solidity Compiler" button in the left-hand sidebar and selecting the appropriate version of Solidity (0.8.19).
Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy & run transactions" button in the left-hand sidebar, selecting "MyToken" from the dropdown, and clicking the "Deploy" button.


# Executing program

After you have deployed the contract, you can interact with it by calling its functions. To mint new tokens, call the mint function with the address you want to mint to and the number of tokens you want to mint. To burn tokens, call the burn function with the address you want to burn from and the number of tokens you want to burn.

# Help

If you have any issues with the contract, please refer to the Solidity documentation or seek help from the Solidity community.
